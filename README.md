# CAT_API
Images &amp; breed information


## Project Structure
- A public GitHub repository containing your project
- An **HTML** document for the page
- A **CSS** document to style the HTML page
- A **JavaScript** file that retrieves data from one of several public API sources to display the data on your HTML page
- A **README** file that includes instructions for running the webpage (This does not need to be a live site; you can instruct the user to download and run locally)

## Content
- Display data for at least **2 models/data points** from the API
- Include **navigation** between each model's page and other models being displayed. Your site should have at least **two clickable navigation links**. When the user clicks each link, you can either:
  - Route them to a different HTML file that displays the data from your API call, **or**
  - Re-render your single HTML page to update with the new data
- Issue new **GET requests** for the linked data to display in the linked pages:
  - Use **two separate GET requests** for each of the two data points
  - When the user clicks a navigation button, it should trigger the GET request for the appropriate data

## Functionality
- Code runs without issues by following the instructions in the README file
- **Navigation** between the different models behaves properly and is efficient (not slowed down by requesting more data than necessary)
- Code is readable and well-structured
- Error cases, if applicable, are appropriately handled
- Styling is effective:
  - **Font sizes** are not too small or large
  - **Colors** are easy to read (not too dark or light to be seen clearly)
